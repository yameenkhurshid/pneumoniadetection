# Pneumonia Detection with AI
Pneumonia is a type of lung inflammation caused by viral or bacterial infections. This leads to the filling of the air sacks in your lungs with fluids - leading to coughing, high fevers, chills, and difficulty breathing.
Sadly, millions of children worldwide are affected by this.
That's why it should be taken very seriously.
So if your doctor has any reason to believe that you have pneumonia, a chest X-ray will be performed to figure out two factors: The location of the infection and how far it has spread. 
Traditionally, when the X-ray is completed, a doctor will analyze the images to find those factors. However, they may not always be correct. 
Pneumonia is one of the most misdiagnosed medical conditions. 
So if a patient has pneumonia but is misdiagnosed as without it, their condition can drastically worsen - leading to death.
But there is one way that we can change this. 
Artificial Intelligence!
